## About the Project

This is a simple static website that I created years ago during my first encounter with coding in 2021. The site is built using only HTML and CSS and showcases my initial exploration into web development. The theme of the site revolves around the art of horror, with a focus on grotesque and unsettling manga.

## Features

- **Static Site**: Built using pure HTML and CSS.
- **Thematic Focus**: Explores horror manga, specifically the works of Suehiro Maruo and Junji Ito.
- **Simple Layout**: A straightforward layout with images and textual content.
- **First Project**: This project represents my first steps into the world of coding and web design.

## Content Overview

### Header

The header of the site includes an image and a title:

- **Title**: "The Art of Grotesque Horror"
- **Header Image**: A visual introduction to the theme of the website.

### Posts

The main section of the site is dedicated to posts about horror manga:

- **Manga Post**: Discusses the works of Suehiro Maruo and Junji Ito, two masters of horror manga.
  - **Images**: The post includes images such as "Tomie" and "The Laughing Vampire" to illustrate the content.
  - **Content**: The text describes the unique styles of both Maruo and Ito, highlighting their contributions to the horror genre.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Future Improvements

As I look ahead, there are a few exciting ways this project could evolve. Iâ€™m considering:

- **Adding User Authentication**: To allow users to create accounts and personalize their experience on the site.
- **Integrating a Backend**: To support dynamic content and manage data more effectively.

These updates would not only enhance the functionality but also offer a richer experience for visitors.
